# Hexbug spider library for Arduino

This library uses an IR LED to send codes that can be understood by an
[Hexbug Spider][1].

The IR LED is expected to be wired to your Arduino's pin #3.

## Minimal code example

```c
// Channel the Hexbug Spider is listenning to ('A' or 'B'), must be defined
// before including hexbug-spider.h. 
#define HEXBUG_SPIDER_CHANNEL 'A'

#include "hexbug_spider.h"

// Pin the IR LED is wired to. Must be a PWM pin.
#define PIN_IR_OUTPUT    3

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Point your IR LED to an Hexbug spider.");

  hexbug_spider_setup_pin(PIN_IR_OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  hexbug_spider_left();
  delay(100);
}
```

## How to install

1. Install the [IRDump.h][2] library.
3. Include the `hexbug_spider.h` file into your main Arduino code, for instance
   `#include "hexbug_spider.h"`.
