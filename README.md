# Hexbug spider library for Arduino

![Hexbug Spider](https://content.hexbug.com/images/animation/spider.gif)

This library uses an IR LED to send codes that can be understood by an
[Hexbug Spider][1].

## Wiring everything together

To build this project you'll need:

1. And Arduino board.
1. An IR LED.
1. A red LED (optional).
1. A 200 to 1000 ohm resistor.

Wire one of the PWN pins of the Arduino board (this example uses pin 3) to the
largest leg of the IR LED, the second leg goes to the longest leg of the red
LED via the resistor, the second leg of the red LED goes to ground.

Should look like this:

Here's an schematic view of the same setup:

## Minimal code example

1. Install the [IRDump.h][2] library.
1. Include the `hexbug_spider.h` file into your main Arduino code, for instance
   `#include <hexbug_spider.h>`.

```c
// Channel the Hexbug Spider is listenning to ('A' or 'B'), must be defined
// before including hexbug-spider.h.
#define HEXBUG_SPIDER_CHANNEL 'A'

#include <hexbug_spider.h>

// Pin the IR LED is wired to. Must be a PWM pin.
#define PIN_IR_OUTPUT    3

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Point your IR LED to an Hexbug spider.");

  hexbug_spider_setup_pin(PIN_IR_OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  hexbug_spider_left();
  delay(100);
}
```
